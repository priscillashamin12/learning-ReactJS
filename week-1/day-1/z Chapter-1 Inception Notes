NAMASTE REACT JS

Mission - Zero to Hero in React JS in 8 weeks
Document - https://beta.reactjs.org/apis/react/createElement 
CDN Link - https://reactjs.org/docs/cdn-links.html 

Chapter 01 - Inception 

Tips:
React element is a object
We can use react in other big projects 
It take some time for react to get rendered. Because the CDN link api needs to be fetched.
React wanted to write HTML, CSS inside JS, then react came up with React/ReactDom (React.createElement) api, then JSX


1. Library Vs Framework
React JS	Angular

2. Tools
Google chrome
VS Code
Extensions:
    Better Comments
    Bracket Pair Colorization
    ES7
    GitLens -> for git
    Prettier ->. Code format
    Viscode-icons
    Tailwind CSS IntelliSense
    HTML CSS Support
    CSS Peek 
    Prettify JSON
    Tabnine AI Autocomplete

3. Home work
Read about emmet - gives code boilerplate
CDN - content delivery network
Cross origin
DOM Manipulation
Difference between async / differ (watch video - akshay)

4. Shortest program
JS -> empty file -> window
React -> index.html -> CDN Links

5. Console
Type for React -> React / ReactDOM (access to all api)
Type for JS -> document (access to all api)

6. CDN
Gives access to React DOM

7. React Popularity
React API

8. Can we have multiple root? -> no, most app has one root and one render method.

HOMEWORK
Emmet - Emmet is a free add-on for your text editor. It allows you to type shortcuts that are then expanded into full pieces of code. By using Emmet, developers type less, they save both on keystrokes and time.

Library	Framework
Flexible	Structured
Reusable functions	Reusable code that can be modified
React JS	Angular, Vue

React CDN combination reduces the distance between the server and the user to accelerate the delivery of library assets so that webpages would load faster.
Both React and ReactDOM are available over a CDN.

cross origin resource sharing
Requesting data from One url to another url

async vs defer attributes in Javascript 
 External scripts -> async
Multiple scripts -> defer (goes in order)

Why is React known as React?
React was developed for applications (Facebook) that have constantly changing data. Since React is a front-end framework or the “View” in MVC, this means that as the user clicks around and changes the app's data, the view should “react” or change with those user events.

The library reacts to the state changes.

What is diference between React and ReactDOM
React library is responsible for creating views and ReactDOM library is responsible to actually render UI in the browser.

How JavaScript updates the DOM?
JavaScript uses DOM API to updates and manipulates DOM nodes. The DOM API is just a collection of objects that JavaScript uses to manipulate the DOM. The manipulation here means CRUD(create, read, update, and delete) operations in DOM nodes.

What is difference between react.development.js and react.production.js files via CDN?
Both React and ReactDOM are available over a CDN.
<script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react@18/umd/react.development.js"></script>
<script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@18/umd/react-dom.development.js"></script>
The versions above are only meant for development, and are not suitable for production. Minified and optimized production versions of React are available at:
<script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react@18/umd/react.production.min.js"></script>
<script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@18/umd/react-dom.production.min.js"></script>
